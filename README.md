# Qualtrics Google Map Lat/Long Collector

#### Getting Started
Create or open a Qualtrics survey. You must be able to add JavaScript to a question for this code to work (it will not work on trial accounts where this feature is unavailable).

#### Making a Lat/Long Collection Question
Start by making a new _Text Entry_ question. You can treat this question like you would any other (ex. require a response, change the title, etc.). It is recommended that you provide instructions in the question (see _Using the Question_ below).

On the left side of the question, click the gear and select _Add JavaScript..._

Select everything in the box and clear it. The JavaScript box should be empty before pasting the code.

Copy the JavaScript from the [file](https://github.com/pkmnct/qualtrics-google-map-lat-long/blob/master/QualtricsGoogleMapLatLong.js) and paste it in the box.

At the top of the pasted code, find the section labeled _Enter your Google Map API key in this variable._

Replace the text _Your Key_ with your own API key (see the Google Maps documentation _[Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)_).

Scroll down to the section labeled _Variables_ and edit the variables as needed.

Click Save. Test the question before sending out the survey.

#### Using the Question
By default, an autocomplete field is created to assist in finding a location. Responders can enter a location into this field and the map will snap its marker to that location. They can then fine-tune the response by dragging the marker to a specific location (such as a door to a building).

If you would like to disable the autocomplete field, set the variable _enableAutocompleteField_ to _false_. Users can then just drag the pin to the desired location.

The result is collected in the Qualtrics question field as a JSON object. It will be in the format as follows:

`{"lat": "38.8951", "long": "-77.0364"}`
