# Qualtrics Google Map Lat/Long Collector

##### Getting Started
Create or open a Qualtrics survey.

#### Making a Question
Start by making a new _Text Entry_ question. You can treat this question like you would any other (ex. require a response, change the title, etc.).

On the left side of the question, click the gear and select _Add JavaScript..._

Select everything in the box and clear it. The JavaScript box should be empty before pasting the code.

Copy the JavaScript from the file and paste it in the box.

At the top of the pasted code, find the section labeled _Enter your Google Map API key in this variable._

Replace the text _Your Key_ with your own API key.

Scroll down to the section labeled _Variables_ and edit the variables as needed.

Click Save.
